            <strong>The basis of studies</strong> at the Department of Arts <strong>is research, analysis and the formation</strong> of relationships between art, design and public spaces.
            Educators at the Department of Arts support creative and innovative thinking in the field of creation, <strong>reception and critique</strong> of artistic creation
            in public space. They prefer a multidisciplinary approach to creative practice with the active use of all available media. These may include the
            creation of 2D and 3D <strong>physical and digital</strong> objects, installations, environments, but also drafts for interventions in urban, landscape and mixed
            public spaces and various ways of individual and community participation of the civil public in their creation.

                    The subject of work in the studio is mainly free artistic creation and an innovative view of creation in public space.
                    We develop the ability to explore and analyze the relationships between art, private and public shared spaces and all
                    the circumstances of their interaction. We deal with the strategies and functions of art in public space, the conditions
                    of their reception and criticism. Students gain knowledge about the social, cultural and artistic infrastructure of
                    community and societal environments. Our program supports creative and innovative thinking in the field of creation,
                    reception and critique of artistic creation in public space and prefers a multidisciplinary approach to creative
                    practice with the active use of all available media.

                    The studio is profiled as a platform for discussions and experiments exploring and looking for new possibilities in spatial
                    creation, specifically focused on expositional, scenographic or generally understood creation of the environment. The reason
                    for this study is to look for new qualities and to offer innovative solutions to the issue of creating an environment. Current
                    cultural, sociological and ecological problems are solved here. The environment is understood here not only as a kind of filling
                    (atmosphere) of spatial masses but above all as a "complex" of many elements.

                knowledge and practical skills in creation in a publicly shared space. The basis of the study is the research, analysis and formation
                of relationships between design, art and publicly shared spaces formed by civil society. The study deals with the ways, procedures
                and methods of creation in public space, the conditions of their reception and criticism. The main goal of the study is to provide
                students with space for the development of their own creative potential, insight and critical thinking in the field of public space creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The study program Fine Arts - Creation in Public Space deals with design on the border and outside the borders of individual artistic fields
                and media. The creation of current relations between these and other fields is directly connected with the concepts and performances of the
                community, public (civic) activities and initiatives. The study program follows the current tendencies of interventions in public space and
                prepares experts who will actively influence the quality of public space.

            <p>
                Graduates of the program will work as designers of objects and environments in public space in all its contexts.
                They can also work as independent artists in the fields of free or applied arts, as members and collaborators
                of art, design, architectural and urban studios and groups, but also as consultants for civic initiatives and
                community associations. Graduates create works in the public space (objects of installation and environment)
                designed without restrictions by classical and modern artistic, architectural and urban types and media. They
                can include the creation of 2D and 3D physical and digital objects, installations, environments, but also various
                drafts for interventions in urban, landscape and mixed public spaces and places, and finally various ways of
                individual and community participation of the civic public in their creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally, even a purposefully educated graduate will be able to combine various expert approaches in practice and
                share creative processes with professions often isolated in professional chambers or artistic associations/groups.
                He will be able to critically reconsider the relationship of these professions to the public interest in practice
                and in theory, and also to take into account the various tensions between science, technology and art in the field
                of public space. The graduate of the bachelor's study program will obtain a degree similar to other art universities -
                bachelor of arts (abbreviation BcA.)

                design and implementation of independent artistic concepts and projects in the field of art, society and media.

                physical space, which is shared and provides inspiration to its surroundings. It deals with concepts developing
                public (civic) activities and initiatives.
